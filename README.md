<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a comprehensive analysis of a synthetic healthcare dataset I downloaded from kaggle. I made use of SQL and PowerBi to explore, analyze and visualize hospital admission records to derive key insights from patient data such as medical conditions, blood types, and medications administered. This project covers the full data analysis workflow from data cleaning to business-oriented insights.

 It answered questions like:
- What is the most dispensed medication?
- Which gender, blood type and medical conditions had the highest hospital admissions?
- What are the top 3 medical conditions reported for urgent vs emergency hospital admissions?
- What are the most common medical conditions with hospital admissions over the years?
- What are the most common medical conditions of each blood type?
- What are the most common medical conditions of each gender?
- Which medical condition had the highest length of stay and the average length of stay per admission of each medical condition?
- Which age had the highest length of stay and the average length of stay per admission of each age?
- What is the most common medication by test results?
- Top medication administered by medical condition

### Built With

* [Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)
* [Microsoft PowerBi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/downloads)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project and run the queries, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
* Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL).
* Microsoft PowerBi
* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for querying.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KosyEzenwaji/Healthcare-data-analysis-with-SQL.git
   ```
2. Open the .sql file in a SQL IDE (like MySQL Workbench or DBeaver)
3. Step through the queries to see how the analysis was built
4. View the .pdf report to explore the Power BI visuals

<!-- BUSINESS RELEVANCE -->
## Business Relevance

This analysis mirrors a real-world healthcare scenario where data-driven insights can:
- Optimize hospital resource allocation
- Improve treatment planning by identifying long-stay or high-risk conditions
- Support decision-making around insurance and patient support services
- Enhance care personalization through blood type and demographic segmentation


## Contributing

The open-source community is an incredible place to learn, be inspired, and develop because of contributions. Any contributions you make to this SQL project will be much appreciated.


### Reporting Issues:
If you encounter any issues with the queries or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue with a detailed description of the problem.
